# random thoughts about what to do next.
# suggestions welcome

- document $mail{Sender}
- support SMTP AUTH

- Check with mod_perl

- During Makefile.PL, try to find a local SMTP server and the user's e-mail
address, and offer to pre-configure these as defaults in Sendmail.pm. And
let the user enter defaults to override automatic detection.

- Document $address_rx: which addresses it finds OK, and which not.

- Add example scripts for CGI forms

- Also accept hashrefs in place of hashes

- Update web site

- Create sourceforge site and mailing list

- Does the test say OK if no mail could be sent? check and fix

- Check we don't die if sending to multiple recipients, and one fails

Also accept MIME::Lite objects?

Have make dist generate README and html ?

Add install.ppm for PPM installs?

Use 8BITMIME if available from server?

Encode only if accented chars really present?

Also MIME-encode headers if they contain accented characters? Make it configurable?

Rename to Mail::Simple?


Not on my todo list anymore:

- Setup Perl on an Amiga and see if it runs. (it should)
(but if someone tries it, I would appreciate knowing about it)

NAME
    Mail::Sendmail v. 0.71 - Simple platform independent mailer

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::Sendmail;

      %mail = ( To      => 'you@there.com',
                From    => 'me@here.com',
                Message => "This is a minimalistic message"
               );

      if (sendmail %mail) { print "Mail sent OK.\n" }
      else { print "Error sending mail: $Mail::Sendmail::error \n" }

      print STDERR "\n\$Mail::Sendmail::log says:\n", $Mail::Sendmail::log;

DESCRIPTION
    Simple platform independent e-mail from your perl script.

    After struggling for some time with various command-line mailing
    programs which didn't give me all the control I wanted, I found
    a nice script by Christian Mallwitz, put it into a module, and
    added a few features I wanted.

    Mail::Sendmail contains mainly &sendmail, which takes a hash
    with the message to send and sends it...

    sendmail is exported to your namespace.

INSTALLATION
    - Copy Sendmail.pm to Mail/ in your Perl lib directory (eg.
    c:\Perl\lib\Mail\, c:\Perl\lib\site\Mail\,
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/Mail/, ... or whatever it is on your
    system)

    - At the top of Sendmail.pm, set your Time Zone and your default
    SMTP server

    - If you want to use MIME quoted-printable encoding, you need
    MIME::QuotedPrint from CPAN. It's in the MIME-Base64 package. To
    get it with your browser go to
    http://www.perl.com/CPAN//modules/by-module/MIME/

FEATURES
    - Mime quoted printable encoding if requested (needs
    MIME::QuotedPrint)

    - Bcc: and Cc: support

    - Doesn't send unwanted headers

    - Allows you to send any header you want

    - Doesn't abort sending if there is a bad recipient address
    among other good ones

    - Makes verbose error messages

    - Adds the Date header if you don't supply your own

LIMITATIONS
    Doesn't send attachments (you can still send them if you provide
    the appropriate headers and boundaries, but that may not be
    practical).

    Not tested in a situation where the server goes down during
    session

USAGE DETAILS
    sendmail
        sendmail is the only thing exported to your namespace

        `sendmail(%mail) || print "Error sending mail:
        $Mail::Sendmail::error\n";'

        - takes a hash containing the full message, with keys for
        all headers, Body, and optionally for another non-default
        SMTP server. (The Body part can be called "Body", "Message"
        or "Text")

        - returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

        updates `$Mail::Sendmail::error' and `$Mail::Sendmail::log'.

        Keys are not case-sensitive. They get normalized before use
        with `ucfirst( lc $key )'

    The following are not exported, but you can still access them
    with their full name:

    Mail::Sendmail::time_to_date()
        convert time ( as from `time()' ) to a string suitable for
        the Date header as per RFC 822.

    $Mail::Sendmail::VERSION
        The package version number

    $Mail::Sendmail::error
        Fatal or non-fatal socket or SMTP server errors

    $Mail::Sendmail::log
        You can check it out after a sendmail to see what it says

    $Mail::Sendmail::address_rx
        A handy regex to recognize e-mail addresses

          Example:
            $rx = $Mail::Sendmail::address_rx;
            if (/$rx/) {
              $address=$1;
              $user=$2;
              $domain=$3;
            }

    $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_server
        see Configuration below

    $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_port
        see Configuration below

    $Mail::Sendmail::TZ
        Time Zone. see Configuration below

CONFIGURATION
    At the top of Sendmail.pm, there are 2 variables you have to
    set:

    - your Time Zone (until I change the module so it finds the TZ
    itself). (1 hour for daylight savings time is added if your
    system says it should be)

    - your default SMTP server.

    and the port number if your server doesn't use the default port
    25 (which would be surprising, but who knows).

    If you want a different server only for a particular script put
    `$Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_server = 'newserver.my-
    domain.com';' in your script.

    If you want a different server only for a particular message,
    add it to your %message hash with a key of 'Smtp':
    `$message{Smtp} = 'newserver.my-domain.com';'

ANOTHER EXAMPLE
      use Mail::Sendmail;

      print STDERR "Testing Mail::Sendmail version $Mail::Sendmail::VERSION\n";
      print STDERR "smtp server: $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_server\n";
      print STDERR "server port: $Mail::Sendmail::default_smtp_port\n";

      %mail = (
          #To      => 'No to field this time, only Bcc and Cc',
          From    => 'Myself <me@here.com>',
          Bcc     => 'Someone <him@there.com>, Someone else her@there.com',
          # only addresses are extracted from Bcc, real names disregarded
          Cc      => 'Yet someone else <xz@whatever.com>',
          # Cc will appear in the header. (Bcc will not)
          Subject => 'Test message',
          'Content-transfer-encoding' => 'quoted-printable',
          'X-Mailer' => "Mail::Sendmail",
      );

      $mail{Smtp} = 'special_server.for-this-message-only.domain.com';
      $mail{'X-custom'} = 'My custom additionnal header';
      $mail{message} = "Only a short message";
      $mail{Date} = Mail::Sendmail::time_to_date( time() - 86400 ), # cheat on the date

      if (sendmail %mail) { print "Mail sent OK.\n" }
      else { print "Error sending mail: $Mail::Sendmail::error \n" }

      print STDERR "\n\$Mail::Sendmail::log says:\n", $Mail::Sendmail::log;

CHANGES
    0.71: Fixed Time Zone bug with AS port. Added half-hour Time
    Zone support. Repackaged with \n line endings instead of \r\n.

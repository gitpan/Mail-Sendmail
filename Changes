Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Sendmail.

0.74  Fri Jul 31 14:50:54 1998
      - Fixed $/ problem: mailing would hang if caller had redefined
        the record separator. It's now locally set to "\015\012". 
      - corrected reading of %mail hash passed to sendmail: it would
        abort on a false value (the trap is clearly mentionned in the
        perl docs: shame on me!)
      - added configurable retries when failure to connect to server 
      - much more error checking
      - more warnings to STDERR, but only if running with -w flag.
      - changed $address_rx, so it accepts user@hostname, not only
        user@host.top, and also accepts weird but legal characters
      - Message body is now all of Message, Body and Text instead
        of the first not empty one (if you don't mind the final
        message being in random order, you can now be really sloppy
        when filling in the message from your script!).
      - use strict.
      - Added Makefile.PL.
      - updated doc

      - Added half-hour Time Zone support.
